# CREDIT-EDA-CASE-STUDY
Urban customers are the target market for a consumer finance company's many forms of loans.When a loan application is received, the company must decide whether to approve the loan based on the applicant's profile. The bank's choice is subject to two different kinds of risks:

1. If the borrower is likely to repay the loan, refusing to grant it results in the company losing business. 
2. If the borrower is not likely to pay back the loan, or is likely to default, authorising the loan could result in a loss for the business. 

The business needs to comprehend the elements that are reliable predictors of loan default, sometimes known as the driving factors (or driver variables) behind default. This information can be used by the business for portfolio management and risk analysis
